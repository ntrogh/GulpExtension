# GulpExtension
 Brings Gulp Support to Azure Websites via a Site Extension  http://www.siteextensions.net

The extension is invoked automatically upon deploying a new version through source control integration.
If you have a gulpfile.js file in the root of the website, it will be taken into account by the extension.
